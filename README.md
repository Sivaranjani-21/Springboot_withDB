Spring Boot Backend Application with H2 Database
Spring Boot Backend

Description

This is a simple Spring Boot backend application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using an H2 in-memory database. It serves as a template for building Java web applications with Spring Boot, allowing you to quickly set up a backend for managing records in tables.
The application showcases how to create, retrieve, and update records in a database and can be used as a foundation for more complex projects that require database interactions.

Features
Spring Boot application structure with controllers, services, and repositories
Integration with an H2 in-memory database for easy development and testing
Demonstrates basic CRUD operations on a sample entity
Customizable for adding more entities and functionality

How to Use

Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Build and run the Spring Boot application.
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
The application exposes RESTful endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.
You can customize the application by adding your own entities, controllers, services, and repositories.
The H2 in-memory database can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/h2-console (JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:dcbapp, username: sa, password: password).



Testing and Visualizing the API with Insomnia


Insomnia is a popular REST client that allows you to send HTTP requests to your backend API and visualize the responses. You can use Insomnia to test and interact with the endpoints provided by this Spring Boot backend application.


Sending API Requests

Open the imported workspace in Insomnia.
You will find a collection of requests corresponding to the API endpoints of this Spring Boot application.
Modify the request parameters as needed, such as request headers, request bodies, and endpoints.
Click the "Send" button to execute the request.

Viewing API Responses

Insomnia will display the API response, including status codes, response headers, and response bodies.
You can view the data returned by your Spring Boot backend application directly in Insomnia.
Use this feature to test, debug, and visualize the behavior of your API endpoints.

Example API Requests
Here are some example API requests that you can try using Insomnia:

Create Record: Use a POST request to create a new record.
Retrieve Records: Use a GET request to retrieve a list of records.
Update Record: Use a PUT request to update an existing record.
Delete Record: Use a DELETE request to delete a record.
